Ensuring functional and secure code involves rigorous testing, including unit, integration, and security testing, coupled with regular code reviews and static analysis. Dependency scanning and continuous monitoring are crucial for identifying vulnerabilities and responding promptly. Interpreting user needs requires thorough requirements gathering, user stories, prototyping, and effective communication with stakeholders. Approaching software design entails understanding requirements, prioritizing modularity, emphasizing user-centric design, and scalability, and incorporating security measures from the outset. Agile principles, documentation, and regular reviews foster an iterative and adaptive development process. Overall, success lies in a comprehensive, user-focused, and security-conscious approach that evolves with feedback and changing requirements throughout the software development lifecycle.
